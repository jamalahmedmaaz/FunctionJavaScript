Why Functional Programming

1. Because imperative code operates at such a precise level of detail, they are often one-shot implementation
or at best, difficult to reuse. Further imperative languages are often restricted to a level of detail that is good
for the compilers rather than for their programmers.

2. It allows abstraction to separate out domain logic from generic verse assembly machinery.

3. It provides the notion and means for empowering our data through the use of generic functions built on a collection-
centric philosophy.

4. Data Thinking: In OOP we model our data by getter and setter. A more flexible approach to modeling data is an associative data
technique. JavaScript objects, even minus the prototype machinery, are ideal vehicles for associative data modeling,
where named values can be structured to form higher-level data models, accessed in uniform ways.

5. It is very easy to mimic SQL behaviour using Functional Programming. It also helps in writing data transformation jobs
easy. Best suiting the ETL requirement.

6. Functional Programming make the programmer think deeply about their data, the transformations occurring on it and the 
hand-over format between the layers of their application.
